# Object-Oriented-Programming-I

This repository contains assignments and code solutions for the Object-Oriented Programming I course(COMP248) . It includes multiple assignments focusing on object-oriented principles, written in Java.

## Assignments

1. **Assignment 1:**

   - **Question 1:** Crypto Change Program
     In this project, I developed a Java program that calculates cryptocurrency change in various denominations. The program simulates a system where a user buys a ticket with 1 Pesico (7500 Cryptom coins) and receives change based on the ticket price entered by the user. The program is designed to return the change using the largest denominations first, ensuring simplicity for the user.

     ** Key Features:**

     - Input: The program prompts the user to input the price of a ticket in Cryptom (between 1 and 7500 Cryptom).
     - Change Calculation: The program calculates the change that needs to be returned to the customer, ensuring that larger denominations are prioritized (i.e., minimizing the total number of coins).
     - Output: The calculated change is displayed in terms of Pesico, Bitom, Ditom, Zitom, and Cryptom denominations, with the largest denominations used first.

   - **Question 2:** Simple Cinema Tickets Invoice Program
     For the second part of this assignment, I created a Java-based invoice generator for a cinema that accepts prepaid gift cards. The program calculates how many movie tickets can be purchased with the card and provides a detailed invoice for the user.

     ** Key Features:**

   - Input: The user is prompted to enter the name of the prepaid gift card retailer, the balance on the gift card, and the number of tickets they wish to buy.
   - Ticket Calculation: The program calculates the number of tickets that can be purchased, with each ticket costing $6.99, and also computes the remaining balance on the gift card.
   - Invoice Generation: A detailed invoice is generated, displaying the number of tickets purchased, the amount redeemed from the gift card, and the remaining balance.
   - Date Entry: The user inputs the date of purchase, which is displayed on the final invoice.
   - Output: The invoice includes a formatted output of all relevant information along with a final "Thank you" message.
