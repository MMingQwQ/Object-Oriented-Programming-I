# Object-Oriented-Programming-I

This repository contains assignments and code solutions for the Object-Oriented Programming I course (COMP248). It includes multiple assignments focusing on object-oriented principles, written in Java.

## Assignments

1. **Assignment 1:**

   - **Question 1:** Crypto Change Program

     - **Content:** The program simulates a currency exchange system, requiring the calculation of optimal change using large denominations.
     - **Knowledge Tested:**
       - Use of loops and conditionals to break down a value into different denominations.
       - Handling user input effectively.
       - Output formatting and problem-solving related to real-world currency calculations.

   - **Question 2:** Simple Cinema Tickets Invoice Program
     - **Content:** The program processes prepaid gift card balances, computes the number of movie tickets that can be bought, and generates an invoice.
     - **Knowledge Tested:**
       - Managing user input and performing validations.
       - Implementing arithmetic calculations to determine the remaining balance after purchasing tickets.
       - Structuring and displaying outputs in a professional invoice format.
       - String manipulation for displaying the gift card retailer's name in uppercase.

2. **Assignment 2:**

   - **Question 1:** Static Latency-Computer Program

     - **Content:** The program simulates monitoring the bandwidth and latency between two computing nodes over a Metropolitan Area Network (MAN). It calculates the latency between nodes based on user-provided bandwidth and IP addresses.
     - **Knowledge Tested:**
       - Handling user input for bandwidth in specific formats (e.g., Mbps).
       - Validating IPv4 addresses entered by the user.
       - Using arithmetic operations to calculate the latency between nodes.
       - Structuring outputs based on network conditions, including error handling for invalid inputs.

   - **Question 2:** Dynamic Latency-Computer Program
     - **Content:** This program dynamically calculates latency based on the day of the week, mode (Bandwidth or Latency), and data quantity. It uses predefined tables to map bandwidth and latency values according to daily conditions.
     - **Knowledge Tested:**
       - Validating user inputs for the day, mode, and data quantity.
       - Using `switch` statements to process user input and calculate values based on predefined data for bandwidth and latency.
       - Implementing case-insensitive input handling for different data units (GB, PB, ZB).
       - Displaying formatted output with calculated latency, and managing error handling for invalid inputs.

3. **Assignment 3:**

   - **Question 1:** Simple Brilliant Mind Game Jackpot Program

     - **Content:** The program is designed to simulate a general knowledge game, where participants answer questions across ten categories, each with a fixed score value. The game uses nested loops to calculate cumulative rewards based on the numbers in each category that are not multiples of the category number.
     - **Knowledge Tested:**
       - Implementing nested loops to process values that meet specific conditions.
       - Managing user input, including validation of age within a specified range.
       - Summing and processing cumulative rewards based on non-multiples of the category score value.
       - Output formatting to display the results for each category and the final cumulative reward.

   - **Question 2:** Simple Exam Registration Program
     - **Content:** This program simulates a course registration system for a university's exam center. The system allows ACSD personnel to manage course listings, add students, and display registration details using arrays and text manipulation.
     - **Knowledge Tested:**
       - Implementing arrays to store and manage course lists and student data.
       - Handling and validating user input for course names, sections, and student registration.
       - Structuring menu-based interaction with multiple options, including adding and listing courses and students.
       - Displaying sorted course and registration data, and managing error handling for invalid input options.
